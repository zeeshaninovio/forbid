                    Trailer Inspections (by appointment only)The Sheriff’s Office may inspect trailers to obtain a new
                    Vehicle Identification Plate where a trailer is homemade or circumstances where a new Vehicle
                    Identification Plate is required. The State Law allows for the Sheriff to charge a fee of $25.00 per
                    trailer inspection. Form 5062 from the Missouri Department of Revenue is required to complete this
                    process. You can obtain these forms at your local License Fee Office or at the Sheriff’s Office. The
                    applicant should complete Section A of the form and have that available when the Sheriff’s Office
                    arrives to inspect the trailer. Should you have questions or would like to schedule a time for an
                    inspections, please contact our office at 660-885-7300 during regular business hours.
