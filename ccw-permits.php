                    The Sheriffâ€™s Office by state law issues permits for Carry a Concealed Weapon. Before a permit can

                    outline in the State Statutes section 571.111. The basic requirements are listed below, however an
                    applicant is directed to the Revised Statutes of Missouri for the most current and complete
                    information about the training and application process. The current fees for a new permit is $100.00
                    and requires a fingerprint submission background check. Renewing a permit is a $50.00fee and
                    requires a background check. New and Renewed permits are valid for five (5) years unless otherwise
                    revoked by the Sheriff. If you have questions, please call our office at 660-885-7300
